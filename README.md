## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

- Styled components using CSS to achieve a clean and responsive layout.
- Integrated Chart.js library to render the bar chart dynamically.

**Functionality and Interactivity:**

- Dynamically loaded data into the chart using JavaScript.
- Implemented animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
- Added interactive features like tooltips and hover effects on the chart.

**Final Touches:**

- Ensured accessibility by testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- Optimized performance and responsiveness across various devices.
- Deployed the project to Vercel for live testing and demonstration.
